**Minimum Window Substring**

Given two strings—s and t, find the smallest window substring of t. The smallest window substring is
the shortest sequence of characters in s that includes all of the characters present in t. The frequency
of each character in this sequence should be greater than or equal to the frequency of each character in t.
The order of the characters doesn’t matter here.

Constraints:

Strings s and t consist of uppercase and lowercase characters.
- t.length ≤ s.length
- 1 ≤ s.length
- t.length ≤ 10^3


**Longest Substring without Repeating Characters**

Given a string, input_string find the longest substring without repeating characters, and return the length of that longest substring.

Constraints:
1 ≤ input_string.length ≤ 5 X 10^4
 
input_string consists of English letters, digits, symbols, and spaces.
