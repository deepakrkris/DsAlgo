**Merge Two Sorted Lists**

You are given the heads of two sorted linked lists list1 and list2.

Merge the two lists in a one sorted list. The list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.

Return the head of the merged linked list.

Example 1:
Input: list1 = [1,2,4], list2 = [1,3,4]
Output: [1,1,2,3,4,4]

Example 2:
Input: list1 = [], list2 = []
Output: []

Example 3:
Input: list1 = [], list2 = [0]
Output: [0]

Constraints:

The number of nodes in both lists is in the range [0, 50].
-100 <= Node.val <= 100
Both list1 and list2 are sorted in non-decreasing order.



**Reverse Linked List**

Given the head of a singly linked list, reverse the list, and return the reversed list.

 
Example 1:
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [5,4,3,2,1]

Example 2:
Input: head = [1,2]
Output: [2,1]

Example 3:
Input: head = []
Output: []

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the list is the range [0, 5000].
-5000 <= Node.val <= 5000

Follow up: A linked list can be reversed either iteratively or recursively. Could you implement both?
