**Valid Palindrome**
Write a function that takes a string s as input and checks whether it’s a palindrome or not.

Note: A phrase, word or sequence is a palindrome that reads the same backwards as forwards.

Constraints:
1 ≤ s.length ≤ 2× 10^5
 
The string won’t have any spaces and will only consist of ASCII characters.


**Sum of Three Values**
Given an array of integers, nums, and an integer value, target, determine if there are any three integers in nums whose sum equals the target. Return TRUE if three such integers are found in the array. Otherwise, return FALSE.

Constraints:
 - 3 ≤ nums.length ≤ 1000
 - 10^3 ≤ nums[i] ≤ 10^3
 − 10  ≤ target ≤ 10^3


**Reverse Words in a String**
Given a sentence, reverse the order of its words without affecting the order of letters within a given word. All operations must be done in place.

Constraints:
The length of the sentence should be equal to or more than one character or word.
Sentence contains English uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, and spaces.
1 ≤ sentence.length ≤ 10^4
 
The order of the letters within a word is not to be reversed.
